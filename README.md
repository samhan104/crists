User creates account
    - adds account info document to collection

User logs in
    - checks collection to see if account info is correct
        - if correct, then logs in
        - else, returns an error

    - When logged in
        - have the routes be under the username of the user
            - example: example.com/username/new, etc
        - have if/else statements to check session to see if logged in
            - if not logged in or session expires and try to go to example.com/username/new, redirects to login page


3 databases
    - one that stores created users
    - one that stores sessions
    - one that checks if the user has already been created, and checks if they have
    an active session, then lets them into the rest of the file paths
        - this database have the path of the individual username
