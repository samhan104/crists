home - see the lists you have by the title

Show - see the contents of the lists
        - if possible, have edit/delete buttons next to each array value
            - when edit, it'll just turn the array value it's next to as the one to be updated
            - delete will just delete
        
        - have an add button to add to the current list
        -back button
